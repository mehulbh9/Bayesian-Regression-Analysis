# Bayesian Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for performing Bayesian regression analysis. The script includes functions for plotting prior and posterior distributions, as well as making predictions based on the regression model.

## Project Description

The `regression.py` script performs Bayesian regression using a Gaussian prior and likelihood. It includes functions to:
- Plot the prior distribution of the regression coefficients.
- Compute and plot the posterior distribution given training data.
- Make predictions on new data points and plot the results.
